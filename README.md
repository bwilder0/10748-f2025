## Course Description
Forecasting epidemics is hard: disease outbreaks are driven by an enormous set of factors ranging from the microscopic details of the immune system to the social dynamics of people’s behavior. Are epidemics predictable? And how can data and machine learning methods help us predict them better?

This course will present:
1. The fundamentals of infectious disease modeling  
2. Statistical and machine learning methods to track and forecast epidemics  
3. The design and optimization of public health interventions  
4. Recent attempts to leverage modern machine learning tools (deep learning, generative AI) in forecasting  

Throughout, students will gain hands-on experience building models, exploring novel data sources, and evaluating forecasters.

## Logistics

- **Questions:** Piazza  
- **Assignment submission:** Gradescope  

Both of the above can be accessed through the course Canvas page.
